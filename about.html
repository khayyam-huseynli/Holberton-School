                    Hello everyone! 
                    My name is Khayyam. Actually I'm not a Front-End web developer. 
                    I graduated from Baku State University with a bachelor's degree in Physics.
                    Then I got a master's degree in Nanotechnology.
                    As a senior petroleum engineer, I've 10+ years of working experience in Application of nanotexnology in oil and gas production.
                    But I always had passion to numbers, math and computers. I really enjoy solving tasks related to programming without any 
                    motivation! 
                    Thus, I decided following my passion and started learning "Data Science" with Python, especially "machine learning". 
                    Then I started to Back-End development with Python. 
                    I've 1+ years of learnin experience and freelance projects. I've developed fully functional restaurant management API project with
                    Django and Django REST framework and machine learning research project that describes the impact of unemployment rate in crime rate.

                    My goal is creating web applicaton that supports machine learning models, especially on Healthcare. With this app doctors will be able
                    to analyze the analysis results of patients and this will help them to make more accurate decisions. Actually that is why I've choosed
                    Autism Spectrum Disorder as the topic for my site. This is an opportunity for impact in my community!

                    Now, I  want to change my career to IT sector. I think joining the Holberton School Software Engineering Programme will contribute
                    to my knowlegde and will help me become professional software engineer. This is my dream job and I can even resign from my current job for  realizing this dream!
