                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <img class="small" id="smart_thumbnail" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f90ff6a5f71bf45a0c0256c/1606871553343-3NUCEHB5S1N3VAEVSLGT/autism+bubble.jpg?format=1000w">
                <p>
                    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. 
                    Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first 2 years of life.

                    According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association that health care providers
                    use to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD often have:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people</li>
                    <li>Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors</li>
                    <li>Symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life</li>                    
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience.
                    People of all genders, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds can be diagnosed with ASD. Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments and services can
                    improve a person's symptoms and daily functioning. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for autism. Caregivers should talk
                    to their child's health care provider about ASD screening or evaluation.

                <p><h3>Signs and symptoms of ASD</h3></p>
                <p> 
                    list below gives some examples of common types of behaviors in people diagnosed with ASD. Not all people with ASD will have all behaviors, but most will have several of the behaviors listed below.
                </p>
                <p><h3>Social communication / interaction behaviors may include:</h3></p>

                    <li>Difficulties sharing in imaginative play or in making friends</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h3>Restrictive / repetitive behaviors may include:</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors, such as repeating words or phrases (a behavior called echolalia)</li>
                    <li>Having a lasting intense interest in specific topics, such as numbers, details, or facts</li>
                    <li>Showing overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or parts of objects</li>
                    <li>Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty with transitions</li>
                    <li>Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input, such as light, sound, clothing, or temperature</li>
                </ul>  
                <p>  
                    People with ASD may also experience sleep problems and irritability.
                    People on the autism spectrum also may have many strengths, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time</li>
                    <li>Being strong visual and auditory learners</li>
                    <li>Excelling in math, science, music, or art</li>
                </ul> 
                
                <p><h3>Causes and related factors</h3></p>  
                <p>
                    Researchers don't know the primary causes of ASD, but studies suggest that a person's genes can act together with aspects of their environment to affect development in ways that lead to ASD. Some factors that are associated with an increased likelihood of developing ASD include:

                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Having a sibling with ASD</li>
                    <li>Having older parents</li>
                    <li>Having certain genetic conditions (such as Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome)</li>
                    <li>Having a very low birth weight</li>
                </ul>
